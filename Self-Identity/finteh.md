# finteh

We are a non-governmental organization Association of Financial Technologies [finteh](https://github.com/finteh) - a community of developers, entrepreneurs and fans of financial technologies. Enjoy us [finteh.t.me](https://finteh.t.me). In 2019, an incubator [fincubator](https://github.com/fincubator) for fintech projects with open source and free licenses was launched by the association. In 2019, the incubator acquired a GPU server and launched a validator Cyb.ai (currently not running on the main network). The President [Kwaskoff](https://github.com/kwaskoff) of the association is a regular staker in the cosmos network, participant in discussions on governmental forums and cosmos-ecosystem telegram groups. Right now incubator is launching the Graphene hub - Axelar technology project by Cosmos-SDK for bringing IBC to the graphene-based framework blockchains: EOS, Steemit, BitShares and their forks.
Now we want to revive staking by our community and pay more attention to the cosmos ecosystem!💪
