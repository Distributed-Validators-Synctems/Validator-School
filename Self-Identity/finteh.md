# finteh

We are a non-governmental organization Association of Financial Technologies @finteh - a community of developers, entrepreneurs and fans of financial technologies. Enjoy us finteh.t.me. In 2019, an incubator @fincubator for fintech projects with open source and free licenses was launched by the association. In 2019, the incubator acquired a GPU server and launched a validator Cyb.ai (currently not running on the main network). The President @kwaskoff of the association is a regular stakeholder in the cosmos network, participant in discussions on governmental forums and cosmos-ecosystem telegram groups. Right now incubator is launching the Graphene hub - cosmos-SDK project on Axeler technology for bringing IBC to the graphene-based framework blockchains: EOS, Steemit, BitShares and their forks.
Now we want to revive staking by our community and pay more attention to the cosmos ecosystem! ðŸ’ª
